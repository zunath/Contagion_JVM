# Project Description

This project contains the Java source code used on the Contagion: Afterlife server. 

It serves as a replacement for NWScript and handles most server features and functions. This is possible by using the NWNX_JVM plugin for NWNX. Refer to this forum for more info on what this is: http://www.nwnx.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1478

This can ONLY be run on a Linux server due to the fact that there is no equivalent Windows plugin.

Refer to the quick start guide below and be sure to post any issues on our forums. The link to the forums is above.
